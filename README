NAME
    CPAN::Changes::Markdown - Format your Changes file ( or a section of it
    ) in Markdown

VERSION
    version 0.1.0

SYNOPSIS
        use CPAN::Changes::Markdown;

        my $changes = CPAN::Changes::Markdown->load( $path_to_changes_file );

        print $changes->serialize # emits Markdown

DESCRIPTION
    Mostly, this is wrapper around CPAN::Changes that just formats the
    output differently.

    Primary use case for me is writing "Github" release notes.

    I plan to eventually have hook filters and stuff to highlight various
    tokens in a "Github" friendly way.

METHODS
  "load"
        my $ccm = CPAN::Changes::Markdown->load( path/to/file );

  "serialize"
        my $string = $ccm->serialize();

ATTRIBUTES
  "changes"
